## Pics List App

Displays a list of images based on user search in a grid CSS format. 

App uses event handlers, binds 'this' with arrow functions, uses dynamic spans for styling with state defined spans for image cards, passes props to children components, passes callbacks from parent to child for child to call the callback, and uses .map to render a list of image cards.

## Available Scripts
`npm start` inside the root directory to start application.
